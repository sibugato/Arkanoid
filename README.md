ðŸŽ® My first attempt at making a game with LibGDX

For the most part, this project was created solely to "feel" the capabilities of the framework. I would like to redo and clean up the code a little, but I decided that it would be better to spend time creating the next project. In any case, the game can even be completed (if you see the bells in the corner)
